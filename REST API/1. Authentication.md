# How to Authenticate
There are 3 ways to Connect to the Platform's API. 


## Python SDK M2M (Machine to Machine) Login 
Long-running Python SDK jobs will require an API authentication.

The M2M login flow allows machines to obtain a valid, signed JWT (authentication token) and automatically refresh it without the need for a web browser login.
M2M login is recommended when you want to run commands on the platform without an ongoing internet connection or to run API commands directly from an 
external system to Dataloop.
To use the M2M login, you first need to create a bot user with a unique name:

```python
import dtlpy as dl
dl.login() # use browser login to create the bot
project = dl.projects.get(project_name='myProject') # get your project
myBot = project.bots.create(name='my-unique-name', return_credentials=True)
```

A Bot User on the Dataloop platform is similar to a User with Developer privileges.  The difference is that it runs in the background vs being an interactive user via the Dataloop UI.  You can view the bot user via the UI under Contributors on the Project Dashboard.

Make sure you save the login credentials of the bot you just created for future logins. You can find them using these lines of code:

```python
print("the bot email is "+myBot.email)
print("the bot password is "+myBot.password)
```

Then, you can log in to the Dataloop platform using the Python SDK and your newly created M2M bot credentials:

```python
import dtlpy as dl
dl.login_m2m(email=email, password=password)
```


M2M Login is recommended when:
Wanting to run commands on the platform without an ongoing internet connection
Wanting to run API commands directly from an external system to Dataloop

## The Dataloop Swagger UI 
Swagger UI allows individuals, whether they are members of the development team or end-users, to view and interact with API resources without requiring any implementation details. The visual documentation is generated automatically from the OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger), simplifying both backend implementation and client-side consumption. The Swagger UI offers the ability to perform API requests such as ```GET```, ```POST```, ```PUT```, ```PATCH``` and ```DELETE``` to different endpoints in our backend services like Projects, Datasets, Tasks, etc.

You will need to already be logged in, to use the Swagger UI. An authentication will be completed with the logged in user.

You can [find Dataloop's Swagger UI here](https://gate.dataloop.ai/api/v1/docs/#/).

You can also [find examples of how to use the Swagger UI here]().

## From an External System 
Connect to the Dataloop API environment from an external system you need to get a JWT token.
Use the JWT for every HTTP request to the platform (with bearer authentication).
This is recommended if you wish to use your prefered API Platforms like Postman or Insomnia.
