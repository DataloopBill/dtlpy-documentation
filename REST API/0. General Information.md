# About Dataloop's Rest API
The Dataloop platform offers a RESTful API, HTTP interface that allows developers to perform full code language-agnostic automatic flows.

## Key Features
Editing Metadata -
Add data to describe your items and datasets, such as unique or serial IDs for a sequence of frames or images, location of item creation, sensor position and more.

Bulk Uploads -
Import millions of items without compressing your data quality or separating metadata from items with the bulk upload capabilities.

Direct M2M Integrations -
Perform commands directly through your code, including the automatic creation of projects, datasets, ontologies, and inferencing - all accessible via direct HTTP requests.
