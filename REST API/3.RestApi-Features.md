# API Features
The Dataloop platform offers a RESTful API, HTTP interface that allows developers to perform full code language-agnostic automatic flows.

For additional information about the RESTful APIs, [click here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

### Endpoint & Version
Dataloop API: https://dataloop.ai/platform/data-management/dataloop-api/

### Authentication
You will need a valid [JWT (Json Web Token)](https://jwt.io/introduction) in order to authenticate with the API. 
For production it is recommended to have [API Credentials](https://dataloop.ai/docs/rest-api-connection#api-credentials), but for automatic JWT generation,
or for testing purposes, you may get your temporary tokenthrough our CLI as we will see next.


### Online API Testing
If you are working on the API through our API documentation and you are logged in, your token is already in place for testing.

### Testing the API locally
If you wish to test the API locally on your machine, do the following:

[Go to Dataloop's CLI](https://dataloop.ai/docs/dataloop-cli) To better understand instructions below, and more. Then open the shell/console and login through the browser:

```
copydlp login
```
Once you are logged in, you may obtain your JWT token through the CLI command:

```
copydlp api info
```
The Output for that should be as seen below:
```
copyC:\Users\user>dlp api info
2020-01-06 17:03:07.821841
-- Dataloop info --
environment: https://gate.dataloop.ai/api/v1
user_email: user@dataloop.ai
token: *********your token will be here*********
See "dlp --help" for options
```
Once you receive your token, you will need to add it as an Authorization header with Bearer prefix, using curl for fetching your projects. It should look like this:
```
copycurl -X GET \
  https://gate.dataloop.ai/api/v1/projects \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ********************your token********************'
  ```
