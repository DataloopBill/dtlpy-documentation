Datasets versioning is facilitated using cloning and merging, for an entire Dataset or partially for selected items. Datasets can use Dataloop storage, and then your binary files are actually uploaded, or you can connect your own cloud storage (GCS, S3, Azure). It requires first to set up an integration (secret) with IAM, and then creating a driver with region, bucket and folder information. As changes occur over time, synchronization can be triggered.  \n", "Another option is using linked-items, where you create an item in a dataset that essentially points at a URL where your file resides. These can be quickly added using SDK or CSV file.  \n", "Dataloop has strong data-management tools for filtering items by nearly any aspect, Filtering uses the Dataloop Query Language (DQL), and DQLs can be created and saved in the platform.

A task ties together the data (items), the assignees (annotators) and the work instructions (labels and attributes to use). An item is marked as done in a task by assigning it with a status. By default the status that marks an item as done in an annotation task is Completed, and in QA task - Approved. You can add your custom statuses to adjust the workflow for your needs, for example add \u201cExpert review\u201d status.  \n", "A QA task is generated from all items with \u201cCompleted\u201d status.
