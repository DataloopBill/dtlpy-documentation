# About Dataloop

The <a href="https://dataloop.ai">Dataloop</a> platform allows you to manage unstructured data (pictures, video files, audio files, etc.) and annotate it using various annotation tools (box, polygon, classification etc). Annotation work is divided into tasks, annotation tasks, or QA tasks, which allow for quality assurance by raising issues and requesting fixes from the original annotator. Dataloop automations enable you to run public packages or your own packages as services on multiple compute node types. To achieve any business goal, Dataloop pipelines allow you to combine services (compute) with people (in tasks) and models (for example, pre-annotation).
