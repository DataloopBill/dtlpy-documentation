## Model management

Dataloop Model Management helps you manage your machine learning models. Models on the Dataloop platform are a specific type of FAAS, and changes in deploying or configurations result in different versions of models that can be compared.

**The main concepts of Model Management:**

- [Package](https://dataloop.ai/docs/faas-package)
- [Service](https://dataloop.ai/docs/service-runtime)
- [Model](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation/blob/glossary/docs_build/glossary/glossary.md#model-entity)
- [Artifact](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation/blob/glossary/docs_build/glossary/glossary.md#artifacts-entity)

**Example uses for model management:**

1. Logging metrics (offline mode) for model training
2. Cloning public models from the Dataloop AI Library
3. Building custom models with a model adapter

**Advanced exercises for using models:** 

1. Clone and deploy a pre-trained model. 
2. Upload an image and predict on it (in the deployed models “test” tab)
3. Create your own model adapter for a pre-trained model, and upload to Model Management
4. Upload an image and predict on it (in the deployed models “test” tab)
