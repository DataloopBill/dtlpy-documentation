# Advanced Onboarding Exercise in Python

Welcome to the second step of Dataloop’s Python SDK onboarding process. If you are coming here from the first part of Dataloop’s Onboarding, which teaches how to do basic operations using the Python SDK, this guide is the next step in your journey to learn to use Dataloop.

If you haven’t yet checked that onboarding, you can [find it here](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation/tree/main/onboarding). Also, you can visit our GitHub to get a look at Dataloop’s code and tools repository.

This Onboarding exercise will take you through an interactive and fun guide meant to teach you how to use Dataloop to solve a “real-world” problem. Without further ado, you will now learn how to use Dataloop to find and categorize some escaped magical animals.
The story
Once upon a time, in a world not far from our own, there was a zoo teeming with magical creatures that made you believe in fairy tales. All visitors to the zoo adored these creatures, and the staff nurtured and groomed them.

But, one day all hell broke loose! The animals broke free from their cages and made their way into the city, led by a tiger smarter than Einstein. The zoo staff was hot on their tails, but the animals were as quick as a caffeine-fueled cheetah (or Python coder) and slipped through their fingers.

As the search for the missing animals continued, the zoo's staff realized they needed assistance. As a result, they enlisted the assistance of local authorities to complete the mission. One of the officers knew about Dataloop's deep learning and advanced annotation platform, and he immediately contacted their AI department for help. The police send all the zoo images of creatures to the Dataloop’s AI department, and the hunt began! 

Let’s learn how Dataloop helps the zoo to find all the creatures.
