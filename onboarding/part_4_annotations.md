##Annotations

There are different types of annotations that you can create on the platform. 
In this introduction section we will focus on [classification](https://dataloop.ai/docs/classify-item)
and [bounding box](https://dataloop.ai/docs/create-bounding-box) and [polyline](https://dataloop.ai/docs/create-polygon)

1. [Setup](https://sdk-docs.dataloop.ai/en/latest/tutorials/annotations_image/setup/chapter.html)
2. [Upload annotations](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation/blob/main/tutorials/getting_started/sdk_overview/chapter.md#annotating-items) ( review only box and classification)
