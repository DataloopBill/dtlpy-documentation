    Create and Deploy a Sample Function
    Below is an image-manipulation function in Python to use for converting an RGB image to a grayscale image. The function receives a single item, which later can be used as a trigger to invoke the function:

    You can now deploy the function as a service using Dataloop SDK. Once the service is ready, one may execute the available function on any input:

def func3():

    Execute the function
    An execution is a run of the function on a service with specific inputs (arguments). The execution input will be provided to the function that the execution runs.

    Now when the service is up, it can be executed manually (on demand) or automatically, based on a set trigger (time/criteria). As part of this chapter, we will demonstrate how to manually run the Grayscale function.

    Letâ€™s execute the function and watch the results (display the image):

    The transformed image will be saved in your dataset (?).
    Please note that when invoking the function to run over items from your dataset, you should pass the ID of the resource (itemID).
