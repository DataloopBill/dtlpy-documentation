    The following code consists of two image-manipulation methods:
    1. RGB to grayscale over an image

    You can define multiple different modules in a package. One of the incentives is to have a single code base that can be used by a number of services (for different applications).

    When creating a service from that package, you will need to define which module the service will serve (a service can only serve a single module with all its functions)
