    ##M2M Login
    Long-running SDK jobs require API authentication.
    The M2M flow allows machines to obtain valid, signed JWT (authentication token) and automatically refresh it, without the need for a real user account UI login.

    M2M Login is recommended when you want to:
        - run commands on the platform without an ongoing internet connection
        - run API commands directly from an external system to Dataloop

    ## Log In Via SDK with M2M :
    1. Create a bot user with a unique name:
    Create a bot user with developer permissions to be used for every M2M login.
    You only need to perform this step if this is your first time logging in.
