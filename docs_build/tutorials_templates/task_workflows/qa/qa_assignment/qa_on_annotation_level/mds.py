    ### ItemAnnotations Review
    The Annotation Studio also enables direct feedback for specific annotations. To enable a realtime review, a Reviewer can open an issue on an Annotation.
    The Annotator (person who annotated the issued Annotation) then receives the issue, fixes it and sends it back for a second review.
    The Reviewer may approve the fix or return it as an issue.

    We also support a real-time dialog on items as an annotation, go to <a href="https://dataloop.ai/docs/note-annotation" target="_blank">Note Annotation</a> to learn more.
