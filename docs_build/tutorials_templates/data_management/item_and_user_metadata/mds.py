    # Item and User Metadata
    Entities in the Dataloop platform (items, annotations, Datasets, Recipes etc) all have metadata. The System area is used by Dataloop, and the User metadata area allows you to save your information
    You can then use these User-Metadata fields when filtering and sorting, for example when fitlering items and annotations from the Dataset browser, or when using DQL.

    ##  Add metadata to Item's user metadata

    """
    ## Upload Items and Annotations Metadata
    You can upload items as a table using a Pandas DataFrame that will let you upload items with info (annotations, metadata such as confidence, filename, etc.) attached to it.
    """


def section3():
    """
    ## Annotations Metadata
    Annotations, like any Dataloop entity, has a User metadata section where you can store your custom information, and relate to it when managing and filtering items and annotations
